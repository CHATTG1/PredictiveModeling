# IntroductionUse {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} to perform deep learning analysis. You can leverage algorithms to solve complex semantic problems through the use of the deep learning framework and APIs. 
{: shortdesc}

In {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}}, you work with deep learning by calling API commands.

Deep learning is supported by [frameworks](ml_dlaas_supported_framework.html).

You must set up your deep learning environment by including an [object store](ml_dlaas_object_store.html).

You can work with our [sample models](ml_dlaas_working_with_sample_models.html), or create your own [new models](ml_dlaas_working_with_new_models.html).## Learn more
