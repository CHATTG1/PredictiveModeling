## What is an API Key?

API keys allow you to easily authenticate when using the CLI or APIs that can be used across multiple services. API Keys are considered confidential since they are used to grant access. Treat all API keys as you would a password since anyone with your API key can impersonate your service. 

## Where can I find the version 1 (v1) API?

Although we hope that users will migrate to the [v3 API](http://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/), you still have access to these legacy methods and commands [here](pm_service_api_spss.html#rest-api).

## Can I provide feedback?

Yes, we encourage feedback as we continue to develop this exciting array of services. You may use Intercom to provide feedback. From IBM Watson Studio, click the **Intercom** icon <img src="images/intercom.png" alt="Intercom icon" width="24">, type a comment, and press **Return**.
