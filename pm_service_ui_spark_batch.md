# Deploying batch models

Using the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service, you can deploy a model and
generate predictive analytics by making score requests against
the deployed model.
{: shortdesc}


**Scenario name**: Customer satisfaction prediction.

**Scenario description**: A telecommunications company wants to know
which customers are at risk of leaving. The presented model
predicts customer churn. A data scientist develops a predictive
model and shares it with you (the developer). Your task is to
deploy the model and generate predictive analytics by making
score requests against the deployed model.

## Prerequisites
To work with this example you will need:
* [Object Storage](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/object-storage) instance details, which will be used as input (customer data to score) for the model and storage for the model output. The sample input data csv file can be download from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmservice/wml-sample-models/master/spark/customer-satisfaction-prediction/data/scoreInput.csv). You should push input file to your Object Storage instance.
* [Apache Spark](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark) service instance credentials. You can use this [link](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apache-spark) to create one.


## Using the sample model

1.  Go to the Samples tab of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} Dashboard.

2.  In the Sample Models section, find the Customer Satisfaction Prediction tile and click the Add model button (+).

Now you'll see the sample Customer Satisfaction Prediction model
in the list of available models on the Models tab.

## Creating a batch deployment with Object Storage

1.  Go to the Models tab of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} Dashboard.

2.  From the **Actions** menu, click **Create Deployment**.

3.  In Create Deployment form provide Name, Description and Batch Type.

4.  You must provide the following inputs:

    **Input Connection**: Object Storage details, which will be used as input (customer data to score) for the model and storage for the model output (results.csv in this case, which is automatically created).

    ```
       {
          "source":{
             "fileformat":"csv",
             "firstlineheader":"true",
             "container":"batchjob",
             "inferschema":"1",
             "filename":"TelcoCustomerData.csv",
             "type":"bluemixobjectstorage"
          },
          "connection":{
             "projectid":"252341ed707d4558b5b2da245e785cd7",

             "authurl":"https://identity.open.softlayer.com",
             "password":"eJ_y9R^OE{j?8Ub!!"
          }
       }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    **Output Connection**

    ```
       {
          "target":{
             "fileformat":"csv",
             "firstlineheader":"true",
             "container":"batchjob",
             "inferschema":"1",
             "filename":"result.csv",
             "type":"bluemixobjectstorage"
          },
          "connection":{
             "projectid":"252341ed707d4558b5b2da245e785cd7",

          }
       }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    **Spark Connection**: Spark service Credentials can be found on the Service Credentials tab of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Spark service dashboard.

    ```
{
    "credentials":{
      "tenant_id": "s745-299dcf850a6390-35c9a7ecf27a",
      "tenant_id_full": "ba3dde5a-ee64-4057-9749-299dcf850a63_4c55eb1c-d6fe-4f0a-9390-35c9a7ecf27a",

      "plan": "ibm.SparkService.PayGoPersonal"
    },
    "version":"2.0"
}
    ```
    {: codeblock}

5.  Click **Save**.

The prediction result is saved to a .csv file in IBM Object Storage. Following is a sample row.
