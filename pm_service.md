# Getting started with Machine Learning


IBM Watsonâ„¢ Machine Learning is a full-service Bluemix offering
that makes it easy for developers and data scientists to work
together to integrate predictive analytics with their
applications.

Machine Learning allows you to develop applications that make
smarter decision, solve tough problems, and improve user
outcomes.

The Machine Learning service is a set of REST APIs that can be
called from any programming language.

The focus of the Machine Learning service is deployment, but note
that IBM SPSS Modeler or Data Science Experience is required for
authoring and working with models and pipelines. Both SPSS
Modeler and Data Science Experience (leveraging Apache Spark)
offer various modeling methods that are taken from machine
learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics.

For details about SPSS Modeler and the modeling algorithms it
provides, see [IBM Knowledge Center]().

For details about Data Science Experience and the modeling
algorithms it provides, see [https://datascience.ibm.com](https://datascience.ibm.com).
