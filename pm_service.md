# Getting started with IBM Watson Machine Learning

{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} is a full-service {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offering
that makes it easy for developers and data scientists to work
together to integrate predictive analytics with their
applications. Use {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} to develop applications that make smarter decision, solve tough problems, and improve user outcomes. The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is a set of REST APIs that can be
called from any programming language.

Because the focus of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is deployment, to author and work with models and pipelines you must use additional products, such as IBM® SPSS® Modeler or IBM® Data Science Experience. Both IBM® SPSS®
Modeler and IBM® Data Science Experience (by using Apache Spark)
offer various modeling methods that are taken from machine
learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics.
