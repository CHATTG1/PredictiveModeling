# Getting started with IBM Watson Machine Learning

{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} is a full-service {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} offering
that makes it easy for developers and data scientists to work
together to integrate predictive analytics with their
applications. {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} allows you to develop applications that make smarter decision, solve tough problems, and improve user outcomes.

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is a set of REST APIs that can be
called from any programming language.

The focus of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is deployment, but note
that IBM® SPSS® Modeler or IBM® Data Science Experience is required for
authoring and working with models and pipelines. Both IBM® SPSS®
Modeler and IBM® Data Science Experience (leveraging Apache Spark)
offer various modeling methods that are taken from machine
learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics.

For details about IBM® SPSS® Modeler and the modeling algorithms it
provides, see [IBM Knowledge Center]().

For details about Data Science Experience and the modeling
algorithms it provides, see [https://datascience.ibm.com](https://datascience.ibm.com).
