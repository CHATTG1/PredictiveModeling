# Deploying online models


**Scenario name**: Product line prediction.

**Scenario description**: A company that sells outdoor equipment
wants to build a model that predicts client interest in their
product line. A data scientist prepared a predictive model and
shares it with you (the developer). Your task is to deploy the
model and generate predictions of customer interest by making
score requests against the deployed model.

## Using the sample model

1. Go to the Samples tab of the IBM® Watson™ Machine Learning
   Dashboard.

2. In the Sample Models section, find the Product Line Prediction
   tile and click the Add model button (+).

Now you'll see the sample Product Line Prediction model in the
list of available models on the Models tab.


## Creating the online deployment

1. Go to the Models tab of the IBM® Watson™ Machine Learning
   Dashboard.

2. From ACTIONS menu select Create Deployment.

3. In Create Deployment form provide Name, Description and Online Type.

4. Press Save button.

Now you'll see the online deployment in the list of available deployments on the Deployments tab.


## Obtaining deployment details

You can check the status, scoring endpoint address (`Scoring Endpoint`),
and parameters related to the deployed model.

1. Go to the Deployments tab of the IBM® Watson™ Machine Learning
   Dashboard.

2. From ACTIONS menu select View Details.

Note that `Scoring Endpoint` value is needed to make scoring requests in next step.


## Making score requests

Since your scoring endpoint has been created (`Scoring Endpoint`), you
can now generate predictions by making score requests. In this
scenario, customer records are passed to the predictive model and
sport product prediction is returned.

Sample record header:

```
GENDER,AGE,MARITAL_STATUS,PROFESSION
```
{: codeblock}

Sample record:

```
M,27,Single,Professional
F,56,Unspecified,Hospitality
M,45,Married,Retired
```
{: codeblock}

Request example:

```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: token' -d '{"fields": ["GENDER","AGE","MARITAL_STATUS","PROFESSION"],"values": [["M",23,"Single","Student"],["M",55,"Single","Executive"]]}' https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/v3/wml_instances/{instance_id}/published_models/{published_model_id}/deployments/{deployment_id}/online
```
{: codeblock}

Output example:

```

      "GENDER",

      "PROFESSION_IX",

We can see, for example, that a 55-year-old executive is
interested in Mountaineering Equipment, while a 23-year-old
student is interested in Personal Accessories.
