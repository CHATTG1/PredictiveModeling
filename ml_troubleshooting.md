Here are the answers to common troubleshooting questions about using IBM Watson Machine Learning.
{: shortdesc}

## Getting help and support for Watson Machine Learning
{: #gettinghelp}

If you have problems or questions when using Watson Machine Learning, you can get help by searching for information or by asking questions through a forum. You can also open a support ticket.

When using the forums to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the machine learning development teams.

If you have technical questions about machine learning, post your question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=machine-learning+ibm-bluemix" target="_blank">Stack Overflow <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> and tag your question with "ibm-bluemix" and "machine-learning".

For questions about the service and getting started instructions, use the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/machine-learning/?smartspace=bluemix" target="_blank">IBM developerWorks dW Answers <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> forum. Include the  "machine-learning" and "bluemix" tags.
See [Getting help](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/support/index.html#getting-help) for more details about using the forums.
