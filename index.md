{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} is integrated with [{{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}}](https://datascience.ibm.com).

Learn about machine learning and artificial intelligence in [{{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}}](https://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/wml-ai.html?context=analytics).

{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} enables users to perform two fundamental operations of machine learning: training and scoring.

- **Training** is the process of refining an algorithm so that it can learn from a data set. The output of this operation is called a model. A model encompasses the learned coefficients of mathematical expressions.
- **Scoring** is the operation of predicting an outcome by using a trained model. The output of the scoring operation is another data set containing predicted values.

{{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} is designed to address the needs of two primary personas:

- Data Scientists: Create machine learning pipelines that leverage data transformations and machine learning algorithms. They typically use notebooks or external tools to train and evaluate their models. Data scientists often collaborate with Data engineers to explore and understand the data.
- Developers: Build intelligent applications that use the predictions output by machine learning models.

Although training is a critical step in the machine learning process, {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} enables you to streamline the functioning of your models by deploying them and getting actual business value from them over time and through all of their iterations.

## About

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service is a set of REST APIs that can be
called from any programming language.

The focus of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service is deployment, but you can use IBM® SPSS® Modeler or {{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}} to author and work with models and pipelines. Both SPSS® Modeler and {{site.data.keyword.DSX_full}} that use Spark MLlib and Python scikit-learn offer various modeling methods that are taken from machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics.
