# Working with sample models

<!-- **DRAFT NOTE**: Need to convert to WML examples! -->
You can download sample models for Torch, Caffe, and Tensorflow frameworks to get familiar with using deep learning. The sample model files contain both the model definition files and manifest file for deep learning. We have created sample manifest file for each sample model for you.

## Torch sample models

<!-- **Note to SME**: Please say something in each of these sections about the specific samples and the underlying framework. We shouldn't just start this section with the bulets, but should have an introduction! -->

* [torch-mnist-model](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/torch-model-slos.zip): Sample Torch model for the MNIST dataset.
* [torch-model-slos-manifest](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/torch-model-slos-manifest.yml): Sample Torch model configuration file.

## Caffe sample models

<!-- **Note to SME**: Please say something in each of these sections about the specific samples and the underlying framework. We shouldn't just start this section with the bulets, but should have an introduction! -->

* [caffe-mnist-model](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/caffe-mnist-model.zip): Sample Caffe model for the MNIST dataset.
* [caffe-mnist-manifest](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/caffe-mnist-manifest.yml): Sample Caffe model configuration file.

## Caffe incremental training sample models
<!-- **Note to SME**: Please say something in each of these sections about the specific samples and the underlying framework. We shouldn't just start this section with the bulets, but should have an introduction! -->

* [caffe-inc-model](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/caffe-inc-model.zip): Sample Caffe model that incrementally trains a new model based on weights from a pre-trained model.
* [caffe-inc-manifest](http://dlaas-api.stage1.mybluemix.net/caffe-inc-manifest.yml): Sample Caffe model configuration file.

## Tensorflow sample models
<!-- **Note to SME**: Please say something in each of these sections about the specific samples and the underlying framework. We shouldn't just start this section with the bulets, but should have an introduction! -->
