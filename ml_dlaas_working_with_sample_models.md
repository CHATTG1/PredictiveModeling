# Working with sample models

**DRAFT NOTE**: Need to convert to WML examples!
You can download example models for Torch, Caffe, and Tensorflow frameworks to get familiar with using deep learning. The example model files contain both the model definition files and manifest file for deep learning. We have created sample manifest file for each example model for you.
{: shortdesc}
* Torch example models    -  torch-mnist-model: Sample Torch model for the MNIST dataset.* Caffe example models    -  caffe-mnist-model: Sample Caffe model for the MNIST dataset.* Caffe incremental training example models:    -  caffe-inc-model: Sample Caffe model that incrementally trains a new model based on weights from a pre-trained model.* Tensorflow example models:    -  tf-model: Sample Tensorflow model for the MNIST dataset.* Keras example models:    -  keras-model: Sample Keras/Tensorflow model for the MNIST dataset.* Mxnet example models:    -  mxnet-model: Sample Mxnet model for the MNIST dataset.
    -  After you download the sample models you can follow instructions under Using deep learning via Bluemix to work with these models.
