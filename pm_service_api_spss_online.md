# Deploying online models


**Scenario name**: Customer satisfaction prediction.

**Scenario description**: A Telco Company wants to know which
customers are at risk of leaving. The company asks us to provide
a solution to help answer that question. A Data Scientist
prepares a predictive model and shares it with you (the
developer). Your task is to deploy the model and generate
predictive analytics by making score requests against the
deployed model.

## Using the sample model

1. Download the sample model from the Git repository [here](https://github.com/pmservice/wml-sample-models/blob/master/spss/customer-satisfaction-prediction/model/customer-satisfaction-prediction.str).

2. Use the following request to upload the new model:

   ```
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data;charset=utf-8" -F "model_file=@customer-satisfaction-prediction.str" https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/pm/v1/model/{context_id}?accesskey={accesskey_value}
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Response:

   ```
   {"flag":true,"message":"success to upload stream with given context id context_csp2","url":"http://pmdevlb.pmservice.ibmcloud.com:80/pm/v1/model/context_csp2?accesskey=pcB4lKG1brpgSCEonNoBdzew9kiOOzN8awh1cJ2sHAxf1yyjh50nnrQngWw4DD/tM13eGXGHaJ0voQU+cAi1t/nmJBaSgi+xeMY8Wia68PB227SsqjgA5nvrX+eU9Sbr"}
   ```
   {: codeblock}

3. Use the following request to refresh the existing model:

   ```
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data;Charset=UTF-8" -F "model_file=@customer-satisfaction-prediction.str" https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/pm/v1/model/{context_id}?accesskey={accesskey_value}
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Response:

   ```
   {"flag":true,"message":"success to update stream with given context id context_csp2","url":"http://pmdevlb.pmservice.ibmcloud.com:80/pm/v1/model/context_csp2?accesskey=pcB4lKG1brpgSCEonNoBdzew9kiOOzN8awh1cJ2sHAxf1yyjh50nnrQngWw4DD/tM13eGXGHaJ0voQU+cAi1t/nmJBaSgi+xeMY8Wia68PB227SsqjgA5nvrX+eU9Sbr"}
   ```
   {: codeblock}

4. Use the following request to get a list of all deployed
   models:

   ```
   curl -X GET -i -H "Content-Type:*/*" https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/pm/v1/model?accesskey={accesskey_value}
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Response:

   ```
   [{"stream":"customer-satisfaction-prediction.str","id":"context_csp2"}]
   ```
   {: codeblock}

5. Use the following request to download a copy of a specific
   deployed model:

   ```
   curl -X GET -v -H "Content-Type:*/*" https://ibm-watson-ml.mybluemix.net/pm/v1/model/{context_id}?accesskey={accesskey_value} >> output.str
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Response (this will download the content of the model into an
   output.str file):

   ```

7. Score the deployed model:

   ```
