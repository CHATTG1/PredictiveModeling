# Machine Learning client libraries

Client libraries wrappers for REST APIs of the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service are developed in Python and Scala. We provide [sample notebooks](toc.html/#Sample notebooks) presenting model persistence to {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} repository using client libraries.
{: shortdesc}

The documentation for libraries are available for both Scala and Python programmig languages:

- [Scala Repository documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-scala/)
- [Python Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-python/)

Currently those libraries can be used in [Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com).

Ready to get started? To create an instance of a service or bind
an application, see [Using the service with Spark and Python models](using_pm_service_dsx.html) or
[Using the service with SPSS models](using_pm_service.html).

If you are interested in exploring the API, see [Service API for Spark and Python models](pm_service_api_spark.html) or [Service
API for SPSS models](pm_service_api_spss.html).
