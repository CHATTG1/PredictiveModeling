# Machine Learning client libraries

## Common API client library ``watson-machine-learning-client`` <span class='tag--beta'>Beta</span>
Client library to use the IBM Watson Machine Learning services in Python and available in pip as ``watson-machine-learning-client``.
The following [sample notebook](https://apsportal.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/1fed143e-1877-42bd-b927-7d366e73745b/view?access_token=4b39718f9e1f1de55e6e67e8dcbb5f0cac848f390d73478d0dea9c1a8af24550) shows:
* model persistence,
* online deployment,
* and scoring using common API client.

The documentation for common API client library is available here:
* [Python common API client documentation](http://wml-api-pyclient.mybluemix.net/).

### Restrictions:

* The common API client is in **beta** stage now.
* Xgboost, scikit-learn and pyspark must be installed as prerequisites.


## Repository API client library ``repository``
Client libraries wrappers for Repository REST APIs of Machine Learning service are developed in Python and Scala.
We provide [sample notebooks](toc.html/#Sample notebooks) presenting model persistence to Watson Machine Learning repository using repository client libraries.

The documentation for repository libraries are available here:
* [Scala Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-scala/)
* [Python Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-python/)

Note: Repository libraries are available on [Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com) only.
