# Client libraries

## Common API client library <span class='tag--beta'>Beta</span>

To use the IBM Watson Machine Learning service with the Python programming language, you can use PyPI to install the `watson-machine-learning-client` client library.

For more details how this is done, you can look at the [Spark MLlib notebook](https://apsportal.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/1fed143e-1877-42bd-b927-7d366e73745b/view?access_token=4b39718f9e1f1de55e6e67e8dcbb5f0cac848f390d73478d0dea9c1a8af24550) or [scikit-learn notebook ](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/15b46bd5-dde2-4d59-9d7d-51cc0b860c8b/view?access_token=d8711ad6ae84b3a9c60d43966f961f66adc2c5b89fec18f24c85e40774080e9a) sample notebooks that demonstrate the following techniques:

* model persistence
* online deployment
* scoring using the common API client

The documentation for the common API client library is available [here](http://wml-api-pyclient.mybluemix.net/).

### Restrictions

* The common API client is in **beta**.
* Before you can use the common API client, you must install at least one of the following packages: XGboost, scikit-learn, or pyspark.
* Only Python 3 is supported.

## Repository API client library

Client library wrappers for the repository REST APIs of the Machine Learning service are developed in the Python and Scala programming languages.

For more information about using `repository` client libraries to present model persistence to the Watson Machine Learning repository, see the [sample notebooks](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/89492fd6-a641-4819-9176-3d9381561df9/view?access_token=d80bef1a172d1d83d3721b101886337158457281774186f181a2e6a5b57f5ec7).

For more information about the repository libraries, see the following topics:

* [Scala Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-scala/)
* [Python Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-python/)

### Restrictions

Repository libraries are available only when you use [IBM Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com).
