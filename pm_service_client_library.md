# Machine Learning client libraries

Client libraries wrappers for REST APIs of Machine Learning service are developed in Python and Scala.
We provide [sample notebooks](toc.html/#Sample notebooks) presenting model persistence to Watson Machine Learning repository using client libraries.
The documentation for libraries are available here:
[Scala Repository documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-scala/)
[Python Repository Module documentation](https://watson-ml-staging-libs.mybluemix.net/repository-python/)

Currently those libraries are available on [Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com).
