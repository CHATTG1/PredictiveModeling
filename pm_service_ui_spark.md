# Service Dashboard


The Machine Learning service on top of [REST APIs](https://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/) provides Administration Dashboard.
Manage models in the administration dashboard, and use the dashboard to create online, batch, or streaming deployments integrated with your applications.

Manage the Data Science Experience files (Spark and Python models)
that are available on an instance of the Machine Learning service
through the Watson Machine Learning Dashboard:

*  Work with samples (models, notebooks and applications)

*  Display model details

*  Deploy a model as:

   *  Online deployment (scoring)

   *  Batch deployment (supporting IBM Object Storage and DashDB)

   *  Streaming deployment (supporting IBM MessageHub)

*  Get deployment details

*  Delete a deployment

*  Delete model



See the following sections for Dashboard examples of:

*  [Online deployment](pm_service_ui_spark_online.html)

*  [Batch deployment with Object Storage](pm_service_ui_spark_batch.html)

*  [Streaming deployment with MessageHub](pm_service_ui_spark_streaming.html)
