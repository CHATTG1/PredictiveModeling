# Service Dashboard

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service on top of [REST APIs](https://watson-ml-api.mybluemix.net/) provides Administration Dashboard.
Manage models in the administration dashboard, and use the dashboard to create online, batch, or streaming deployments integrated with your applications.
