# Scoring with a deployed predictive model

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.pm_full}} service to post the input data to use by the deployed model through the use of an API call. You can use this method to generate and return the predictive analytics in the score results.

```
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Parameters:
        Path parameters:
            contextId: the identifier of the deployed model to use to process this score request
