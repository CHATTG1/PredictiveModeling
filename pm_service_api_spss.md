# Service API


The Machine Learning service is a set of REST APIs called from
any programming language, permitting integration of IBM SPSS
Modeler developed analytics in your applications. Bind your
Bluemix applications to the Machine Learning service instance and
generate the predictive analytics that your applications need to
deliver higher value to your users. Manage your SPSS models in
the administration dashboard, and use the dashboard to update or
refresh your models without stopping or redeploying your
applications.

Manage the SPSS Modeler files that are deployed on an instance of
the Machine Learning service:

*  Deploy a new predictive model

*  Refresh a deployed predictive model

*  Download a copy of a deployed predictive model

*  Delete a deployed predictive model

Develop applications against the IBM SPSS Modeler files that are
deployed on a service instance:

*  Retrieve the metadata for a given deployed predictive model

*  Generate predictive analytics by making score requests against
   deployed predictive models
