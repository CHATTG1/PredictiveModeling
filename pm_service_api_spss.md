# REST API

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is a set of REST APIs that you can call from
any programming language and that provides integration with IBM® SPSS®
Modeler analytics in your applications. Bind your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} applications to the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service instance and
generate the predictive analytics that your applications need to
deliver higher value to your users. Manage your IBM® SPSS® models in
the administration dashboard, and use the dashboard to update or
refresh your models without stopping or redeploying your
applications.
