# REST API

The {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service is a set of REST APIs that you can call from
any programming language and that provides integration with IBM® SPSS®
Modeler analytics in your applications. Bind your
{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} applications to the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service instance and
generate the predictive analytics that your applications need to
deliver higher value to your users. Manage your IBM® SPSS® models in
the administration dashboard, and use the dashboard to update or
refresh your models without stopping or redeploying your
applications.

Manage the IBM® SPSS® Modeler files that are deployed on an instance of
the {{site.data.keyword.pm_short}} service. Specifically, you can perform the following tasks:

*  Deploy a new predictive model.
*  Refresh a deployed predictive model.
*  Download a copy of a deployed predictive model.
*  Delete a deployed predictive model.

Develop applications with the IBM® SPSS® Modeler files that are
deployed on a service instance:

*  Retrieve the metadata for a deployed predictive model.
*  Generate predictive analytics by making score requests against
   deployed predictive models.
